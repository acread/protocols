## Setaria Planting
Setaria seeds don't always germinate very well - it seems like they need several weeks/months to break dormancy \
Zach has done some experimenting with liquid smoke and has had some success \
But it seems like GA treatment is the way to go - \
here's how we're doing it:

1. Remove seedcoats with very primitive "bottle and plastic mat" method
2. Collect de-coated seeds in 1.7mL tube
3. submerge in GA solution for 24 hours at 28c (I do room temp sometimes)
4. if going onto soil, seeds can be directly sown into moist soil and covered with ~3/4 inch moist soil
5. if going onto sterile media, the seeds must be treated with 10% bleach prior to plating.

### GA solution (30mM KN03, 1.4mM GA)
to 5mL H20, add 70uL 100mM GA and 150uL 1M KNO3

### Stock solutions
34.6 mg GA into 1mL EtOH = 100mM
505 mg KNO3 into 5mL H20 = 1M
